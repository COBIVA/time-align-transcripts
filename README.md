# Time-alignment of CESA transcripts (with conversion to WebVTT format)
This R script was used to autogenerate timestamps in CESA transcripts for each speaker turn based on existing timestamps occuring every minute. After formatting the transcript according to WebVTT standards, the duration between each timestamp is calculated and divided in equal increments between different speakers.
